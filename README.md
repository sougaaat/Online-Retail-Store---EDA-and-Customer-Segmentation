# EDA & Customer Segmentation for Online Retail Store

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Customer Segmentation** for an online retail store. We'll dive into the dataset, understand its structure, and uncover insights about customer behavior.

## Project Overview

### Dataset
- The dataset we're working with is called <a hred = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/online-retail-dataset"> online_retail.csv </a>
- It contains transactional data from an online retail store.
- The dataset comprises **541,909 entries** and **8 columns**.

### Goals
1. **Data Exploration**: We'll start by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. We'll create a copy of the original data to maintain data integrity.
2. **Initial Exploration**: We'll explore the dataset to understand its basic characteristics.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: We'll handle missing values and outliers.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This step involves digging deeper into the data. We'll:
   - Visualize patterns and trends.
   - Identify key features.
   - Uncover relationships between variables.
5. **Customer Segmentation**: We'll group customers based on their purchasing behavior. This segmentation can help tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Steps

### 1. Loading the Dataset
- We'll read the `online_retail.csv` file into a pandas DataFrame.
- Ensuring data integrity is crucial, so we'll work with a copy of the original dataset.

### 2. Data Exploration
- We'll examine the first few rows of the dataset.
- Check for missing values and data types.
- Calculate summary statistics.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (if any).
- Address outliers (if present).

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize:
  - Distribution of purchase amounts.
  - Seasonal trends.
  - Customer demographics.
- Identify:
  - High-value customers.
  - Popular products.
  - Correlations between variables.

### 5. Customer Segmentation
- Using clustering techniques (e.g., K-means), we'll group customers based on their behavior.
- Segments may include:
  - Bulk buyers.
  - Frequent buyers.
  - Occasional shoppers.
  - High-spenders.
  - Not-so-active buyers.

## Results and Interpretation

- We'll present our findings through visualizations and concise summaries.
- Insights gained from EDA and customer segmentation will guide business decisions.
